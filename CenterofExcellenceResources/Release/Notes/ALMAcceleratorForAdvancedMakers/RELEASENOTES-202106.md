## Upgrade Instructions
If you are upgrading to the latest public preview you will need to perform the following steps. NOTE: We've changed the internal name of the AA4AM Solution in this release. As a result you will need to delete the existing solution which will cause your App Settings to reset and you'll need to reconfigure.

- Delete the Existing managed solution with the schema name PowerPlatformDevOpsALM
- Import the latest AA4AM Solution https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit/releases/download/ALMAcceleratorForAdvancedMakers-1.0.20210521.1/ALMAcceleratorForAdvancedMakers_1.0.20210521.1_managed.zip
- Update your pipeline templates repo with the latest from https://github.com/microsoft/coe-alm-accelerator-templates
  - We have created a new pipeline to make updating of your Azure DevOps Pipeline Templates simpler going forward. The pipeline can be run manually inside of your Azure DevOps project and will download the latest templates for  you and create a Pull Request into your Pipeline Template repo for you to merge any changes.

NOTE to Private Preview Members: In this release we made the decision to remove the build-deploy-Solution pipeline that was available in Private Preview in favor of the new environment specific pipelines. Up until the previous release we were still supporting the old multi-stage pipeline, but it was causing us to have to put in a lot of workarounds to keep supporting it. 
The benefit of the new environment specific pipelines is you can set them up for as many or as few environments as you like and you can also trigger production deployments without a build which will deploy the latest solution from the test pipeline instead of building again
